# Triolingo

## Introduction
Triolingo is a language learning app created with Swift Storyboard. 
The feature of this app is the integrated GPT-3 model to generate questions for users to work with their translation skills. 
Generally, users can practice in English, Japanese, and Spanish, and there are easy, intermediate, and difficult modes to choose. 
Additionally, users can set up the notification time to remind them when to click into the app for the daily challenge.
Finally, all of the questions users have practiced are stored in the "Record" section so they can review them whenever they feel like to do so.
