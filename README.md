# Triolingo

## Introduction
Triolingo is a language learning app created with Swift Storyboard. 
The feature of this app is the integrated GPT-3 model to generate questions for users to work with their translation skills. 
Generally, users can practice in English, Japanese, and Spanish, and there are easy, intermediate, and difficult modes to choose. 
Additionally, users can set up the notification time to remind them when to click into the app for the daily challenge.
Finally, all of the questions users have practiced are stored in the "Record" section so they can review them whenever they feel like to do so.

## Caution
This is only a first-version, uncompleted app, but it's still under development! If you dig into the code, you can see that the data in "Record" section is preloaded (check out the file "DataProvider"). Also, if you want to try out the "Practice" section, you'll need to register an api key from OpenAI and place it in the file "ChatGPTAPIManager".
